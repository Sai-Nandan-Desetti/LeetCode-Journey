**Approach: Two-pointer**
* "Makes sense" to go with a two-pointer approach
* If `height[l]` < `height[r]`:
	* The area enclosed is limited by `height[l]`
	* So, in the hope of finding max area,
	* `l += 1`
* Similarly, if `height[r] < height[l]`:
	* `r -= 1`
* if equal:
	* `l += 1`
	* `r -= 1`
* Keep track of max area throughout

* What do you mean by "makes sense"? Why does the two-pointer approach work?
	* When `l` and `r` are at the two ends of `height`, the width of the container they represent is at its largest.
	* As `l` and `r` are brought closer to each other, the width only keeps decreasing.
	* The only hope for the area to increase then is to find larger heights.
	* So, push that pointer with the limiting (i.e. lower) height.

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        result = 0
        while l < r:
            result = max(result, min(height[l], height[r]) * (r-l))
            if height[l] < height[r]:
                l += 1
            elif height[r] < height[l]:
                r -= 1
            else:
                l += 1
                r -= 1

        return result
```
