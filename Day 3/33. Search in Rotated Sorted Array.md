**Approach 1: Multiple binary searches**

* Binary search the first element of the unrotated `nums`
	* Say, its index is `first`
* Binary search your `target` in the appropriate "half".

* What if the array was not rotated before being passed to the function?
	* Then, `first` equals the length of the array
```
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        l, r = 1, n
        
        while l < r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            if nums[mid] <= nums[mid - 1]:
                r = mid
                break            
            if nums[mid] < nums[0]:
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        first = r

        def binary_search(target, l, r):            
            pos = bisect_left(nums, target, l, r)
            return pos if pos != r and nums[pos] == target else -1

        if nums[0] <= target <= nums[first-1]:
            return binary_search(target, 0, first)
        
        return binary_search(target, first, n)
```

**Approach 2: Single Binary Search**

* For each case of whether `nums[mid]` is less than or greater than `target`,
	* handle the cases when `mid` is in one half and `target` is in the other.
* You can determine in which half an element is by comparing it with `nums[0]`
```
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        
        target_in_first_half = target >= nums[0]
        target_in_second_half = not target_in_first_half
        
        while l <= r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2

            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            
            if nums[mid] > target:
                if nums[mid] >= nums[0] and target_in_second_half:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid - 1

            elif nums[mid] < target:
                if nums[mid] < nums[0] and target_in_first_half:
                    r = mid - 1
                else:
                    l = mid + 1

        return -1
```
