**Approach: Use Hashset 2Sum**
* For each element, `nums[i]`, in `nums`, find a pair that adds up to `-nums[i]`
```
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        n = len(nums)
        
        def twoSum(start, target):
            diff, pairs = set(), []
            for i in range(start, n):
                d = target - nums[i]
                if d in diff:
                    pairs.append([d, nums[i]])
                else:
                    diff.add(nums[i])

            return pairs

        result = set()
        for i in range(n):
            pairs = twoSum(i+1, -nums[i])
            for pair in pairs:
                result.add(tuple(sorted([nums[i], *pair]))) 

        return result
```

**Approach 2: Use 2 pointer for 2Sum**
* Sort `nums`
	* This idea must strike somehow!
	* I realised that we didn't need to maintain the indices of the elements. So, it's ok to sort them and destroy the index positions.
	* But what do we gain by sorting?

* So, is computing `twoSum` better on a sorted array?
	* Time complexity wise: No.
	* Space wise: Yeah.
		* You don't need a hash set anymore.
		* Use two pointers as shown below.
```
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        n = len(nums)
        nums.sort()

        def twoSum(start, target):
            pairs = []
            l, r = start, n - 1            
            while l < r:
                total = nums[l] + nums[r]
                if total == target:
                    pairs.append([nums[l], nums[r]])
                    l += 1
                    r -= 1
                elif total < target:
                    l += 1
                else:
                    r -= 1
            
            return pairs

        result = set()
        for i in range(n - 2):
            pairs = twoSum(i+1, -nums[i])
            for pair in pairs:
                result.add(tuple([nums[i], *pair]))

        return result
```

**Approach 3: No set `result`**
* Don't define `result` as a set. Figure out how to *avoid* duplicates in the first place.
* Three-pointer approach:
	* It's essentially the same as the above approach.
	* For each element that `i` currently points to, we find `j` and `k` such that
		* `nums[j] + nums[k] == -nums[i]`, or
		* `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`
* Note that `i` must point to the left-most occurrence of a repeating element.
	* Since we're searching for a pair for `nums[i]` to the *right* of `i`.
		* Try out the testcase `nums = [-1,-1,2]`.
	* Hence the inner while-loop (that increments `i`) condition.
* The two pointers `j` and `k` tasked with finding the pair are initialized as in the above approach (they correspond to `l` and `r` there.)
* When the total is `0`,
	* You append the triplet to the `result`
	* And, in order to avoid duplicates, shift `j` and `k` until they don't (each) point to an element that they previously pointed to (respectively).
* Since `nums` is sorted, note that `nums[i] <= nums[j], nums[k]`.
	* Thus, if `nums[i] > 0`, you really can't get a `total` that equals `0`.
	* Hence the outer while-loop condition.
```
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        n = len(nums)
        nums.sort()
        result = []

        i = 0
        while i < n - 2 and nums[i] <= 0:
            while i > 0 and i < n-2 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                i += 1

            if i < n - 2:
                j, k = i + 1, n - 1                

                while j < k:
                    total = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k]
                    if total < 0:
                        j += 1                        
                    elif total > 0:
                        k -= 1                        
                    else:
                        result.append((nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]))
                        j += 1
                        while j < n and nums[j] == nums[j-1]: j += 1
                        k -= 1
                        while k >= 0 and nums[k] == nums[k+1]: k -= 1
            
            i += 1

        return result
```

**Approach 3.1**:
* In the above approach, you're doing quite a few redundant computations when you're searching for a pair.
* You can do the shifting of `j` and `k` that you're doing when `total == 0` even when `total != 0`.
