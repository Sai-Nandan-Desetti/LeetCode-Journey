**Approach: Monotonic stack**
* The right-most element's `result` is trivially determined.
* So, try determining `result` from `n-2` down to `0`.
* Given an temperature, you need a data structure that helps you to get to the first temperature on its right that's greater than it as quickly as possible.
	* For example, in `Example 1`, consider the temperature `75`.
		* In order to get to `76`, what if you didn't have to compare it with `69` in between?
		* That is, when you get to `75`, the data structure must have `71`, `72`, and `76`
			* and, it turns out, it's useful to have them in that order.
* What you need is, therefore, a monotonic stack.

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(temperatures)
        stack = [n-1]
        result = [0]*n

        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            while stack and temperatures[stack[-1]] <= temperatures[i]:
                stack.pop()
            if stack:
                result[i] = stack[-1] - i
            stack.append(i)

        return result
```
