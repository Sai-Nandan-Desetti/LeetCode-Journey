**Approach: Sliding window**
* Bound the desired subarray by `l` and `r`.
* Increase `r` while `sum(A[l...r]) < target`.
* We're interested in the smallest `r` such that `sum(A[l...r]) >= target`.
	* Naturally, to break from the while-loop, `r` is one more than desired.
* So that our desired window is `[l...r-1]`.
* Before using this to compute a possible candidate for `min_len`-- the desired result,
	* since we want a window with minimal length
	* push `l` forward while `sum(A[l...r]) >= target`
	* We're interested in the largest `l` such that `sum(A[l...r-1]) >= target` 
		* Again, as with `r`, to break from the while-loop, `l` is one more than desired.
	* So that our desired window is `[l-1...r-1]`.
* Now compute `min_len = ((r-1) - (l-1) + 1) = (r-l+1)`

* Instead of initializing `min_len` to some `inf` or something, you can initialize it to `len(nums) + 1`.
* If it wasn't updated as we slid through `nums`, then there's no desired subarray.
* So, `min_len` retains its initial value.
* Check for that when returning.

class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, 0
        n = len(nums)
        total = 0
        min_len = n+1

        while r < n:
            while r < n and total < target:
                total += nums[r]
                r += 1 
            if total >= target:                
                while total >= target:                    
                    total -= nums[l]
                    l += 1
                min_len = min(min_len, r-l+1)

        return min_len * (min_len != (n+1))
