**Approach: Sliding window**
* Bound your desired subarray (i.e. a subarray whose product `< k`) by `l` and `r`.
* As `l` scans through `nums`
	* Increase `r` to find the largest subarray starting from `l` whose product `< k`.
		* So that all its subarrays can be counted as part of the `result`.
	* You come up with a while-loop to increase `r` as mentioned above.
		* Because of my initialization of `r` (which I landed upon by some trials, but I don't think that's the only way you must initialize), you realize that
		* At the end of the while-loop, `product` equals product of elements in `A[l...r-1]`
			* `A` denotes `nums`.
		* Which means the product of elements in `A[l...r-2]` was still `< k`.
	* Thus, all subarrays in `A[l...r-2]` should be included in the result.
	* We include *only* the subarrays in `A[l...r-2]` *starting* with `A[l]`.
		* This is given by `(r - 2) - (l) + 1 = r - l - 1`.
	* This is because we could discover additional subarrays starting from `l+1`, for example, as we move `r` further.
	* Thus, the next candidate for `l` must be `l+1` itself, which is taken care of by the `for` statement.

**Special cases**:
* The while-loop may exit with `product < k`	
	* This happens when `prod(A[l...r-1]) < k` and `r == n`.
	* So, we need to account for the array `A[l...r-1]` as well.
	* We've already accounted for the subarrays in `A[l...r-2]`; so, we just need to add one more-- if `product < k`.
* `product` is initialized with `nums[0]`; `nums[0]` maybe ` >= k`.
	* Then, you can't enter the while-loop until `product < k`
	* In which case, `l` can be `>= r`.
		* Leading to `result` becoming negative.
		* The `if` condition prevents this.

class Solution:
    def numSubarrayProductLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        l, r = 0, 1
        product = nums[0]
        result = 0

        for l in range(n):
            while product < k and r < n:
                product *= nums[r]
                r += 1            
            if r > l:
                result += (r - l - 1) + (product < k)
            product /= nums[l]

        return result
```
