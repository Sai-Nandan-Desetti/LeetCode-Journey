**Approach: Reverse and Merge**
* Find `mid` (first that think about what "mid" would mean here).
* Reverse the second-half. Truncate the first half.
* Interleave the two lists.
```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        slow = fast = head        
        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        mid = slow
        
        l, cur = None, mid.next
        if cur:
            while (r := cur.next):
                cur.next = l
                l, cur = cur, r
            cur.next = l
        mid.next = None
        
        h1, h2 = head, cur        
        while h2 is not None:
            temp, h2 = h2, h2.next
            temp.next = h1.next
            h1.next = temp
            h1 = h1.next.next    
```

**Previous Attempts**:
* No reversal.
* Time: $O(N^2)$
```py
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        slow = fast = head
        idx = 0
        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            idx += 1
        
        mid = slow
        idx -= (not fast)

        while mid.next:
            cur = mid.next
            mid.next = cur.next

            node = head
            for _ in range(idx - 1):
                node = node.next

            cur.next = node.next
            node.next = cur
            idx -= 1

        return head
```

* Reverse and interleave without truncation.

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.

            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next        
        mid = slow        

        left, cur = None, mid.next
        if cur:
            right = cur.next
            while right is not None:
                cur.next = left
                left, cur, right = cur, right, right.next
            cur.next = left
            mid.next = cur

        interleave = head
        while mid.next:
            cur = mid.next
            mid.next = cur.next
                        
            cur.next = interleave.next
            interleave.next = cur
            interleave = interleave.next.next

        return head
