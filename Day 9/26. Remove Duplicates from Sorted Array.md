**Approach: Sliding Window**
* Have two pointers `l` and `r` such that `l` keeps track of elements placed in their final position and `r` finds new elements to be placed.
* The window contains duplicate occurrences of various elements.
* It expands when it finds a duplicate element
	* That is, when `nums[l] == nums[r]`
	* Since `nums` is sorted, it suffices to check just with the last element that's correctly placed,
		* which is precisely `nums[l]`.
```py
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        l, r = 0, 1
        result = 1

        def windowCannotExpand(l, r):
            return nums[l] != nums[r]

        def updateResult(result, l, r):
            nums[l] = nums[r]
            result += 1
            return result

        def updateLeft(l):
            l += 1
            return l

        def updateRight(r):
            r += 1
            return r

        while r < n:
            if windowCannotExpand(l, r):
                l = updateLeft(l)
                result = updateResult(result, l, r)                
            r = updateRight(r)

        return result
```
