**Approach 2: Iterative**
* It should quickly become clear to you that there's no point comparing `list1.val` with `list2.val`.
	* Suppose you come to a node where `list1.val > list2.val`		
	* You need to swap the two nodes.
		* Note that here too, as in the recursive approach, we're using `list1` to build the final list.
	* So, you'd swap `list1` and `list2`?
		* Then, whatever `list1` was building until then'd be lost!
		* The only way to maintain it is to assign
			* `whatever-list1-was-building.next = list2`
	* We need to keep track of "whatever `list1` was building".
		* It's natural to let `list1` keep track of it!
	* Then, in order to be able to grow the resultant list, you need to actually swap `list1.next` with `list2`.
	* That is, you need to compare `list1.next.val` with `list2.val`.

* So, you'd need to prepend a sentinel node to `list1` and `list1` must point to the `sentinel`.
* Since `list1` is being updated, we need an auxilliary pointer to point to the head of the result.
	* Thus, `sentinel` is necessary.	
* The termination condition:
	* We can compare the values of `list1.next` and `list2` only `while` they're both `not None`.
	* If `list2` is `not None`, then it must be appended to `list1`.		
* Return `sentinel.next`.
