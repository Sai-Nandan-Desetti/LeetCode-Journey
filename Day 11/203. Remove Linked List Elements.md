**Approach 1: Two pointers - Iterative**

* In a singly linked list, if you want to delete a `node`, you have to stand on its previous node to be able to delete it.
	* So, if you want to delete `head`, you need a previous node for it. That's where `sentinel` comes in.
* Here, we have two pointers: `left` and `right`.
	* If `right` finds a node with the desired `val`, it moves *all the way to the right-most node* that doesn't contain that `val`,
	* and updates `left` with that `right`
```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: Optional[ListNode], val: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        sentinel = left = ListNode(val=None, next=head)        
        while left and (right := left.next):
            while right and right.val == val:
                right = right.next
            left.next = right
            left = right

        return sentinel.next
```

**Approach 2: Recursive**

* Standing on `head`, delete the relevant nodes from `head.next` onwards.
	* Which means you need to check that `head` is not `None` in the first place.
* Then, check if `head` too has the desired `val`.
	* If yes, then delete `head` by moving it to `head.next`.
```py
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: Optional[ListNode], val: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head:
            head.next = self.removeElements(head.next, val)
            if head.val == val:
                head = head.next
        
        return head
```
