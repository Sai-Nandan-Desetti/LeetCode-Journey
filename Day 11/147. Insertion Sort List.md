**Approach 1: Insertion sort the values**

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def insertionSortList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        values = []

        node = head
        while node:
            values.append(node.val)
            node = node.next
        
        n = len(values)

        for i in range(1, n):
            val = values[i]
            j = i - 1
            while j >= 0 and values[j] > val:
                values[j+1] = values[j]
                j -= 1
            values[j+1] = val

        node = head
        i = 0
        while node:
            node.val = values[i]
            node = node.next
            i += 1

        return head
```

**Approach 2: Real Insertion sort**

* Approximate the insertion sort described for an array above.
* `i` starts from `1` there.
	* `i` is initialized to `head`, but we start considering nodes from `head.next`
* In general, if you've to work with node `k` (i.e. remove it and place it somewhere else), you've to stand on the node previous to it.
	* Therefore, `cur`, the node currently under consideration, is assigned with `i.next`.
* Remove `cur`.
	* Update `i.next`.
* Where to place `cur`?
	* Use `j` for that.
	* In the above approach, `j` starts from `i` and goes *down* to `0`.
		* We can't afford that in a linked list.
	* We start from the `sentinel` and move upto `i`.
		* We need a `sentinel` because even the `head` node has the potential to be moved.
	* We either move upto `i` or we move until we find a `j` whose next node's `val` is greater than `cur`'s.
		* Set the position of `cur`.
* If `j is i`, then `cur` will be replaced in its prior position.
* So, we can optimize that by first checking if `cur.val > i.val`
	* If yes, then 
		* We don't remove `cur`
			* So, we don't update `i.next`
		* We simply update `i = i.next` and `continue`.
* Return `sentinel.next`
```
class Solution:
    def insertionSortList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        sentinel = ListNode(val=None, next=head)
        i = head
        while i.next:
            cur = i.next
            if cur.val > i.val:
                i = i.next
                continue
            i.next = i.next.next
            value = cur.val
            j = sentinel
            while j.next.val <= value:
                j = j.next
            cur.next = j.next
            j.next = cur

        return sentinel.next
```
