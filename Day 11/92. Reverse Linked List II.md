**Approach 1: Sentinel**

* It's clear that the `next` pointer of the node previous to the `left`'th one will have to be modifed to reflect the reversal.
	* So, we first need to seek this `prevLeft`.
	* After the first `while` loop, `i == left - 1`
* We then use the same iterative logic as in [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/) to reverse the desired sublist.
	* `_left` points to the `left`'th node.
		* We need a pointer here because we need to change its `next` in the end.
	* `i` is incremented by 1 (so that it equals `left`) before we get into the second `while` loop.
	* When we exit this loop,		
		* `cur` points to the head of the reversed sublist.
			* So, `prevLeft.next` must be updated to point to `cur`.
		* `r` points to the node next to the `right`'th node.
			* After reversal, `_left` should be the `right`'th node in the reversed sublist,
				* so, update `_left.next` to point to `r`.
	* Eg: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4`				
		* After the second while loop
			* `prevLeft = 1`, `_left = 2`
			* `l = 3`, `cur = 4`			
				* Set `4.next = 3`
				* Set `1.next = 4`
			* `r = 5`				
				* Set `2.next = 5`
* How do you handle the case when the entire list is asked to be reversed?
	* You need a `prevLeft` for the `head`. Let that be a `sentinel`.
	* The rest of the code doesn't change at all!
* What to return?
	* If only a sublist was asked to be reversed, you simply return `head`.
	* But if the entire list is reversed, then you need to update `head = cur` and then return `head`.
	* Simply returning `sentinel.next` elegantly handles both the cases.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:                  
        sentinel = ListNode(val=None, next=head)
        prevLeft = sentinel
        i = 0
        while i < left - 1:
            prevLeft = prevLeft.next
            i += 1
                    
        l, cur = prevLeft, prevLeft.next
        i += 1
        _left, r = cur, cur.next

        while i < right:
            cur.next = l
            l, cur, r = cur, r, r.next
            i += 1
        cur.next = l
        
        prevLeft.next = cur    
        _left.next = r

        return sentinel.next
```

**Approach 2: One Pass**

* If you don't want to use a sentinel, then you'd have to handle the edge case of reversing the entire list as shown below.
```
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head.next:
            i = 1
            prevLeft = head
            while i < left - 1:
                prevLeft = prevLeft.next
                i += 1

            if left == 1:
                l, cur = None, prevLeft
            else:
                l, cur = prevLeft, prevLeft.next
                i += 1

            _left, r = cur, cur.next

            while i < right:
                cur.next = l
                l, cur, r = cur, r, r.next
                i += 1

            cur.next = l
            if _left.next:
                _left.next.next = cur
            else:
                head = cur
            _left.next = r

        return head
```
