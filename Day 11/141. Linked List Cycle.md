**Approach: Fast and Slow**
* Use the fast and slow pointer approach of [Floyd's cycle detection algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd's_tortoise_and_hare).
	* `slow` and `fast` start from `head` and move one and two steps, respectively.
	*  If they meet at a node in the list, there's a cycle.
* Use a `try-except` block instead of checking for `None` in each iteration (to know if we've reached the end of the Linked List or not (in the absence of a cycle)).
	* If we reached the end, then we'd be trying to access `None.next`, which would result in an `AttributeError`.
	* [Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-EAFP).

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        try:
            slow = fast = head
            while True:
                slow = slow.next
                fast = fast.next.next
                if slow is fast:
                    return True

        except AttributeError as ae:
            return False
```

* Ok. `fast` moves twice as fast as `slow`. But *why* do they actually meet? Why can't it happen that they infinitely chase each other?
	* Imagine it this way, fast pointer moves faster than slow pointer by 1. That is, from slow pointer point of view, it is not moving and the fast pointer is moving at a speed of 1 node per step. So, at some point, if there is a loop, fast pointer meets the slow pointer.
*  And why only *twice*?
	* You can move by any multiple. [Moving twice as fast maximizes efficiency](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5130334).
	* Advance the two pointers at rates `1` and `k`. After taking j steps, the two pointers would be at positions `j` and `jk`, which are coincident. The article shows that for *every* `k` there's a `j` such that after `j` steps both the pointers meet.
