**Approach 1: `O(n)` Stack**
* Push *half* the elements onto a stack and pop the remaining. The linked list is a palindrome if the stack is empty in the end.
	* I figured this was better than building a list of *all* the elements and checking if that's a palindrome or not.
* Think about what *half* must mean wrt even and odd length palindromes.

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:        
        node = head
        n = 0
        while node:
            n += 1
            node = node.next
                    
        stack = []
        node = head
        
        i = 0
        while i < (n >> 1):
            stack.append(node)
            node = node.next
            i += 1

        if n & 1:
            node = node.next
            i += 1
        
        while i < n:
            if node.val == stack[-1].val:
                stack.pop()
                node = node.next
                i += 1
            else:
                return False

        return not stack
```

**Approach 2: `O(1)` space**
* Find the mid point using `fast` and `slow` pointers.
* Reverse first half of the list in-place.
	* See [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/) for an iterative in-place reversal.
	* `rev` plays the same role here as `cur` there.
* Compare with the second half.
```
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        if not head.next:
            return True

        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        mid = slow.next if fast else slow
        
        left, rev, right = None, head, head.next
        while right != slow:
            rev.next = left
            left, rev, right = rev, right, right.next
        rev.next = left
        head = rev

        revNode, node = head, mid
        while node:
            if revNode.val != node.val:
                return False
            revNode, node = revNode.next, node.next

        return True
```

**To do:**
* Find the mid-point and reverse the first half simultaneously.
