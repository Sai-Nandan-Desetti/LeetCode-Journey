**Approach: Hashmap**
* Among the `n` persons `1...n`, who can be the judge?
* `f` is a counter such that
	* for a person `p`,
		* `f[p] += 1` if someone trusts `p`, and
		* `f[p] -= 1` if `p` trusts someone.
* Therefore,
	* `f[town judge] == n-1`

* One minor detail:
	* Why couldn't we simply define `f = defaultdict()`?
		* This will fail for the test case: `n = 1; trust = []`
		* Because it doesn't go into the `trust` for-loop
			* `f` is never initialized
			* `result` is empty
			* so you return `-1`.
			* But answer is `1`.
```
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        f = {i:0 for i in range(1,n+1)}
        for a, b in trust:
            f[b] += 1
            f[a] -= 1

        result = [person for person, followers in f.items() if followers == n-1]
        return result[0] if result else -1
```
