**Approach 1: Binary string**
* **Key Idea**: 
	* Convert the input to a binary string.
		* 32-bit string
		* left-filled with zeros
	* Reverse the string.
	* Convert back to integer and return.
```py
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:        
        return int(f'{n:032b}'[::-1], 2)
```

**Approach 2: Bit by bit**
* Starting from the right-most bit of `n` (given by `n & 1`)
	* Add (i.e. `or`) each bit to the right-end of `rev_n`.
	* Left-shift `rev_n` (by 1) to add a new bit of `n` at the right-end.
	* Place the new bit of `n` to the right-end by right-shifting it (by 1).
* Repeat this 32 times (because we're asked to return a 32 bit unsigned integer).
```py
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        rev_n = 0
        for _ in range(32):            
            rev_n |= (n & 1)
            rev_n <<= 1
            n >>= 1

        return rev_n
```
