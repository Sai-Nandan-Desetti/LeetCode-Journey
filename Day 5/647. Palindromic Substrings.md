**Approach 1: Brute force-ish**
* Go through all possible substrings and determine if each of them is a palindrome or not.
	* We go through those substrings in this way:
		* Iteratively find x-len palindromes where x ranges from 2 to the length of the string.
* Note that all the characters in the string are 1-len palindromes.
	* Hence the `+ n` to `count` in the end.
* Use memoization to avoid rechecking if the smaller strings are palindromes or not.
	* This is the only reason why it's not completely brute force.
	* And why it barely manages to get accepted.

class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:                
        palindromes = {}
        def isPalindrome(l, r):
            if l >= r:
                return True
            if (l, r) not in palindromes:                        
                if s[l] == s[r]:
                    palindromes[(l, r)] = isPalindrome(l+1, r-1)
                else:
                    palindromes[(l, r)] = False

            return palindromes[(l, r)]
        
        n = len(s)
        count = 0
        for palindrome_len in range(2, n+1):
            l, r = 0, palindrome_len - 1
            while r < n:
                count += isPalindrome(l, r)
                l += 1
                r += 1 

        return count + n
```

**Approach 2: Iteratively expand around the center**
* Bound a palindrome by `l` and `r`.
* `l` and `r` start from a center `c` and expand outward.
	* Each character `c` in `s` is a potential center of a palindrome.
* As they expand, if you find a palindrome, `count` it.
* Now, if you expect a *single* character `c` to be the center of a palindrome, then you can only find *odd* length palindromes.
* So, treat all repeating occurrences of `s[c]` as a single unit.
	* That is, given `l` and `r` (and `c`) point to `s[c]`,
	* increment `r` until `r+1` points to a different character.
	* So that `l` and `r` now bound a string of `s[c]`'s.
		* And this string acts as your center.
	* Try out the cases: `s = "baab" and s = "baaab"`.
* Before expanding, a couple more things:
	* Update your center
	* Given an `n`-len string of the same character, how many substrings are palindromes in it?
		* *All* its substrings are palindromes.
		* So, how many substrings are there in an `n`-len string?
			* `n * (n + 1) // 2`
		* Here, `n = same`.
	* Update `count`
* Now expand, and don't forget to `count` any palindromes you find as you expand.
	* Actually, you expand until you don't find a palindrome.
* *Every* character is the center of a potential palindrome
	* If nothing else, at least a palindrome that just contains itself.
* So, repeat `while c < n`.

class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:                
        c = 0
        n = len(s)
        count = 0

        while c < n:
            l, r = c, c
            while r < n-1 and s[r] == s[r+1]:
                r += 1
            same = r - l + 1
            count += same * (same + 1) // 2
            c = r + 1
            while l > 0 and r < n-1 and s[l-1] == s[r+1]:
                l -= 1
                r += 1
                count += 1

        return count
```

**Approach 3: Recursively expand around the center**
* Each character is a potential center of a palindrome.
* Expand around
	* `(i, i)` for odd length palindromes, and
	* `(i, i+1)` for even length palindromes.
* Count the palindromes as you expand.

        def count_palindromes(l, r) -> int:
            count = 0
            while l >= 0 and r < n and s[l] == s[r]:
                l -= 1
                r += 1
                count += 1
            return count         

        return sum(count_palindromes(i, i) + count_palindromes(i, i+1) for i in range(n))
