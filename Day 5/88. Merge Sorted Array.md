**Approach: Reverse traversal**
* It is easiest to fix the largest element in its final sorted position.
	* For the smallest one, you'll have to do some shifting or use some temp storage, etc.
* So, it's natural to determine the positions of elements in descending order.
* What should be termination condition?
	* An example where `nums1` has the smallest element, and one where `nums2` has the smallest element, should convince you why the while-loop condition is as given below.
	* And why we need the extra while-loop.
