**Approach 1: Recursive (Inefficient)**
* Consider the list: `[1,2,3,4,5]`.
	* Standing on `1`, reverse `[2,3,4,5]` to get `5` as the `reverseHead`.
	* From `5` go down to `2`
	* Append `1` to `2`
	* And, set `1.next = None`
	* Do this recursively.
* Recursion base case:
	* Consider the singleton list: `[5]`
	* Reversing from `5.next = None` onwards makes no sense.
		* You'd return `None` as the `reverseHead`
		* When instead it must be `head` itself.
	* So, if the list has a single element, `return head`
* The `try-except` clause handles the special case when the given list is empty.
```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        try:
            if head.next:
                reverseHead = self.reverseList(head.next)            
                node = reverseHead                
                while node.next:
                    node = node.next
                node.next = head
                head.next = None

                return reverseHead
            else:
                return head
        
        except AttributeError as ae:
            return head            
```

**Approach 2: Iterative**
* After some trials, it should click that using three pointers will be helpful here.
* Standing on `cur`, you must set `cur.next` to its `left` node while (somehow) advancing to its `right` node as well!
	* Thus, `right` should have been set to `cur.next` beforehand.
		* Which implies that there should be atleast one node in the given list.
* The `left` of `head` is `None`
* `right` can peacefully update to its `next` node.	
```py
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head:
            left = None
            cur, right = head, head.next        
            
            while right:
                cur.next = left
                left, cur, right = cur, right, right.next

            cur.next = left
            head = cur

        return head
```

**Approach 3: Recursive (Efficient)**
* Consider the same example as illustrated in Approach 1.
* The key point is in "**From `5` go *down* to `2`**".
	* Why go all the way down just to access `2`?
	* You can access it readily as `1.next`!
* Everything else is the same.
```py
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not (head and head.next):
            return head

        reverseHead = self.reverseList(head.next)
        head.next.next = head
        head.next = None

        return reverseHead
```
