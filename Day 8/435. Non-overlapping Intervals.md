**Approach: Sort and Slide**
* The basic idea to sort and slide is the same as in [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/).
* Only `lastInterval` is needed:
	* Observe that in that problem, we were only checking for overlap by comparing with the *last* interval in the window: `result[-1]`.
		* `lastInterval` is analogous to `result[-1]` there.
	* In the case of an overlap, the last interval is updated
	* If no overlap, the `result` is updated so that the last interval is now the new one that's appended.
	* In each case, only `lastInterval` is updated.		
* If there's an overlap, one of the two overlapping intervals needs to be deleted.
	* So, increment `result` by 1.
* Which interval is deleted?
	* We *greedily* delete that interval with the larger end.
	* By "delete", we mean that `lastInterval`'s end is updated with the smaller end.
		* They didn't ask for the actual intervals so we don't bother updating `lastInterval`'s start.

class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort()
        n = len(intervals)

        l, r = 0, 1        
        result, lastInterval = 0, intervals[0]

        def windowCannotExpand(interval):
            return interval[0] >= lastInterval[1]
        
        def updateLeft(l):
            l = r
            return l        
        
        def updateRight(r):
            r += 1
            return r

        while r < n:
            interval = intervals[r]
            if windowCannotExpand(interval):
                l = updateLeft(l)
                lastInterval = interval
            else:                
                lastInterval[1] = min(lastInterval[1], interval[1])
                result += 1
            r = updateRight(r)

        return result
```

* Only `end` is necessary.
	* In the above approach, observe that only the `lastInterval`'s end is being used everywhere.
* Here, I've removed the functions that were added for modularity. Otherwise, it's essentially the same.

    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort()
        n = len(intervals)

        l, r = 0, 1        
        result, end = 0, intervals[0][1]

        while r < n:
            interval = intervals[r]
            if interval[0] >= end:
                l = r
                end = interval[1]
            else:                
                end = min(end, interval[1])
                result += 1
            r += 1

        return result
```
