**Approach: Sets and Counters**
* Find the common characters using `set`
* In the result, a common character occurs a certain number of times: it's the minimum number of times the character appears in each of the `words`.	
	* To find the frequency of a character in a word, use a `Counter`
	* Duplicate the character `x` times, where `x` is the minimum number explained above.
		* This creates a 2-d list, `commonCharsWithDuplicates`
* Flatten this list (using `itertools.chain.from_iterable`) to return the desired result.
```py
import itertools

class Solution:
    def commonChars(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        wordSets = [set(word) for word in words]
        commonChars = set.intersection(*wordSets)
        counters = [Counter(word) for word in words]
        
        # This is a 2-d list where each common character is in a sublist, 
        # where the length of the sublist is equal to the number of times the character appears in ALL the words.
        commonCharsWithDuplicates = [[ch] * min(ctr[ch] for ctr in counters) for ch in commonChars]

        return list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(commonCharsWithDuplicates))
```

* Same basic approach as above, but a more Pythonic way of doing it.

```py
from collections import Counter
from functools import reduce

class Solution:
    def commonChars(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        return list(reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, map(Counter, words)).elements())
```
