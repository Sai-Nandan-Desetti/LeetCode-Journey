**Approach 1: HashSet**
* `&` performs set intersection

**Further reading**:
	* How is a hashset implemented in Python?
```py
class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        return set(nums1) & set(nums2)
```

**Approach 2: Using Masks**
* This approach assumes that you know the range that `nums[i]` could possibly take.
	* Where `nums` refers to either `nums1` or `nums2`.
	* Here, the second constraint in the question gives us the desired range.
		* Let's denote the range by `[minVal, maxVal]`	

**Basic Idea**:	
* Consider an integer `mask`.
* See it as an array of bits.
	* 0-indexed from the right.
* The length of this array is limited by the range of elements in `nums`.
	* In this particular example, `mask` can be, atmost, an array of 1001 bits.
		* Now that could be a pretty large number!
* For each `n` in `nums`
	* Set the bit `mask[n]` to `1`.
	* Note that we can directly set `mask[n]` because
		* `n` is an integer,
		* and `minVal = 0`
	* What if we had, instead, strings of, say, lowercase letters of the English alphabet?
* Take the `intersection` of the masks corresponding to each of `nums1` and `nums2`.
* This `intersection` is again an integer with certain bits set to `1`.
	* Those bits are set that correspond to common integers in both `nums1` and `nums2`.
* Find all such bits and add the corresponding integers to your `result`.

**Implementation**:
* `mask |= (1 << n)` sets the `n`th bit of `mask` to `1`.
	* `0`th bit of `mask` is the rightmost one.
* `reduce()` is more useful when you have `nums1, nums2, ..., numsk`.
* To find the bits that are set in `intersection`, we iterate over `intersection`
	* We check if the `ele`-th bit is set or not.
		* Again, note that, if set, we can append `ele` itself to `result` in this problem.
	* Why don't we iterate over `nums`?
		* We have a *constant* upper bound on the number of bits intersection can atmost take: `maxVal - minVal + 1`
		* whereas we don't have any upper bound for the length of `nums`.
			* Well, you can see the given constraints!
			* Yeah. The point is, I think, it's more common to have knowledge about the range of elements in your array than about the length of the array.
		* Well, in the end, it makes sense to iterate over `intersection` if the number of its bits is (much) lower than the length of `nums`.
			* And this happens if `maxVal < len(nums)`.
			* Going by the constraints in this problem, you can iterate over `nums` as well.

```py
from functools import reduce

class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        def generateMask(nums):
            mask = 0
            for n in nums:
                mask |= (1 << n)
            
            return mask

        masks = [generateMask(nums) for nums in [nums1, nums2]]
        intersection = reduce(lambda a, b: a & b, masks)

        result = []
        ele = 0
        while intersection:
            if intersection & 1:
                result.append(ele)
            ele += 1
            intersection >>= 1

        return result
```

* The above approach for two strings (of lowercase English letters).
* Note
	* value of `minVal`
	* computation of `mask`
	* what's appended to `result`
```py
from functools import reduce

class Solution:
    def intersection(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> str:
        minVal = ord('a')
        
        def generateMask(s):
            mask = 0
            for c in s:
                mask |= (1 << (ord(c) - minVal))
            
            return mask

        masks = [generateMask(s) for s in [s1, s2]]
        intersection = reduce(lambda a, b: a & b, masks)

        result = []
        ele = 0
        while intersection:
            if intersection & 1:
                result.append(chr(ele + minVal))
            ele += 1
            intersection >>= 1

        return ''.join(result)
```
