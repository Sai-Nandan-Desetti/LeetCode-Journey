**Approach 1: Two HashMaps**
* Count the frequencies of each number in both the arrays.
* The `result` contains common numbers with a frequency of the minimum number of times they appear in both the arrays.
```py
from itertools import chain

class Solution:
    def intersect(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n1_ctr = Counter(nums1)
        n2_ctr = Counter(nums2)
        
        result = []

        for k in n1_ctr:
            if k in n2_ctr:
                result.append([k] * min(n1_ctr[k], n2_ctr[k]))

        return chain.from_iterable(result)
```

**Approach 1.1: Two HashMaps**
* This is as Pythonic as it gets.
* `map(func, iterable)` applies `func` on each element of the `iterable`.
* Intersection (`&`) of counters returns the minimum of corresponding counts.
* `elements()` repeats an element as many times as its count.

```py
class Solution:
    def intersect(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n1_ctr, n2_ctr = map(collections.Counter, (nums1, nums2))
        return list((n1_ctr & n2_ctr).elements())
```

**Approach 2: Single HashMap**
* This is the best approach for the third follow-up, when `nums2` is too big.
* This method works fine even if you work with small segments of `nums2` at a time.
```py
class Solution:
    def intersect(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n1_ctr = Counter(nums1)
        result = []

        for n in nums2:
            if n in n1_ctr and n1_ctr[n]:             
                result.append(n)
                n1_ctr[n] -= 1

        return result
```

**Approach 3: Sort and Two Pointers**
* Use this approach if the constraint is to not use a hashmap.
```py
class Solution:
    def intersect(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        nums1.sort()
        nums2.sort()
        m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)

        i, j = 0, 0
        result = []

        while i < m and j < n:
            if nums1[i] == nums2[j]:
                result.append(nums1[i])
                i += 1
                j += 1
            elif nums1[i] < nums2[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j += 1

        return result
```

**Approach 4: Sort and Binary Search**
* I thought of this approach if there was a constraint to sort only the smaller array (and to not use any hashmap).

* Make `nums1` the smaller array (swap if necessary).
* Sort it.
* For `n` in `nums2`, `binarySearch` in `nums1`
	* `binarySearch` returns the left-most position of `n` if found, or that position that `n` should be placed (in `nums1`) to maintain the sorting order.
* How do you handle duplicates?
	* You'll have to search for `n` only in that part of `nums1` *after the position it was previously found*.
	* So, you'll need a map that stores the left-most position of `n` returned by `binarySearch`  (that's what `left` is for).		
	* So, after all, we're indeed using a hashmap!
```py
class Solution:
    def intersect(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n1, n2 = len(nums1), len(nums2)
        if n1 > n2:
            nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1
            n1, n2 = n2, n1

        nums1.sort()

        def binarySearch(target, l, r):            
            while l < r:
                mid = l + (r - l) // 2                
                if nums1[mid] < target:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid
            return l
        
        result = []
        left = defaultdict(int)

        for n in nums2:
            l = binarySearch(n, left[n], n1)
            if l < n1 and nums1[l] == n:
                result.append(n)
                left[n] = l + 1

        return result
```
