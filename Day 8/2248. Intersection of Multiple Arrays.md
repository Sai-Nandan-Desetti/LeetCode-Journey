**Approach: Sets**
* Convert each sublist to a set
* Take the intersection of all the sets.
* Sort the elements in the intersection.
```
from functools import reduce

class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        return sorted(reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, map(set, nums)))
```

* Use built-in `set.intersection`
```
from functools import reduce

class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        return sorted(set.intersection(*map(set, nums)))
```

**Approach 2: Count and Sort**
* There's a reason it's highlighted that all the integers are **distinct** in each sublist.
* Flatten the sublists.
* Count the frequency of each number.
* Any number that appears `len(nums)` is part of the result.
* Sort the result.
```
from itertools import chain
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        return sorted([k for k, v in Counter(chain.from_iterable(nums)).items() if v == len(nums)])
```

**Approach 3: No sort**
**Intuition**:
* It's highlighted that the integers in each sublist are **distinct**.
* The result must be sorted in ascending order.
    * I think the point is to build your result in a way that it turns out to be ascending.
    * Not that you build however and finally sort it!
* Use the constraint: `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

**Approach**:
* For each sublist create a `mask`
* `mask` is an integer.
* See it as an array of bits.
	* 0-indexed from the right.
* The length of this array is limited by the range of elements in each sublist of `nums`.
	* In this particular problem, `mask` can be, atmost, an array of 1000 bits.
		* Now that could be a pretty large number. But Python can handle arbitrarily large numbers!
* Let `arr` be a sublist of `nums`
* For each `n` in `arr`
	* Set the `n-1`-th bit from the right.	    
	    * The right-most bit is the `0`-th bit.
	    * When we "set a bit", we mean we set it to `1`.

* Take the intersection of all these masks.
* The bits that are set in `intersection` correspond to the desired numbers that are common in all the sublists.
* Iterate over each bit in `intersection` to check if the bit is set or not.
    * If set, add the corresponding element to the result.

**Complexity**:
- Time complexity: `O(n)`, where `n = len(nums)`
- Space complexity: `O(n)`, where `n = len(nums)`

```
class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        minVal = 1                
        
        def generateMask(arr):
            mask = 0
            for n in arr:
                mask |= (1 << (n - minVal))
            return mask

        intersection = reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, map(generateMask, nums))

        result = []
        ele = 0
        while intersection:
            if intersection & 1:
                result.append(ele + minVal)
            intersection >>= 1
            ele += 1

        return result
```
