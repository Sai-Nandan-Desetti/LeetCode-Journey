**Approach 1: Expand around the center**
* (From left to right) Consider each letter of the given string as the center of a palindrome and expand around it.
	* `c` points to a candidate center
* What about even palindromes? What is the center there?
* At the end of the single-character-palindrome loop
	* For an even palindrome, say, `"baaaab"`
	* `l` and `r` point to the start and end of `"aaaa"`, respectively.
	* Thus, `"aaaa"` is considered as a center.
		* Note the assignment, `c=r+1`, ensures that none of the `a`'s individually is treated as a separate center.
	* For an odd palindrome, say, `"bab"`
	* `l` and `r` point to `a`.
	* Thus, `a` is considered as a center (as expected in an odd palindrome).

class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        start, maxLen = 0, 0

        c = 0

        while n - c > (maxLen >> 1):
            l, r = c, c
            while r < n-1 and s[r] == s[r+1]:
                r += 1
            c = r + 1
            while l > 0 and r < n-1 and s[l-1] == s[r+1]:
                l -= 1
                r += 1
            if r - l + 1 > maxLen:
                start = l
                maxLen = r - l + 1

        return s[start : start + maxLen]
```

**Approach 2: Recursive**
* Expand about `(c,c)` and `(c,c+1)` for odd and even palindromes, respectively.
```
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        
        def expand(l, r):                       
            while l >= 0 and r < n and s[l] == s[r]:
                l -= 1
                r += 1                

            return r-l+1, l+1

        maxLen, start = max(max(expand(c, c), expand(c, c+1)) for c in range(n))
        return s[start : start + maxLen]
```
