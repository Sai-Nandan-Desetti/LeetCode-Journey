**Approach: O(n) space**
* Intuitively, I just felt that it'd be nice to have the result built as
	* `result[i] = prefix[i] * suffix[i]`
* For which we need `prefix` and `suffix` to be of length `n`.
* Once you try out a couple of examples, you should quickly be able to come up with the expressions given for `prefix[i+1]` and `suffix[~i-1]`.	
	* You need to build `prefix` from left to right
	* And `suffix` from right to left.
* And also that `i` moves forward in `[0, n-1)`
```
def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        prefix = [1] * n
        suffix = [1] * n

        for i in range(n - 1):
            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] * nums[i]
            suffix[~i - 1] = suffix[~i] * nums[~i]

        return [p * s for p, s in zip(prefix, suffix)]
```

**Approach: O(1) Space**
* It should be evident that we don't actually need `O(n)` space to build `prefix` and `suffix` products.
* The only reason I was building them with that much space was because of my need to build the result in the specific way described above.
* Let's remove that constraint and think how else can we build `result`.
	* As `i` moves forward in `[0, n-1)`, notice that, *initially*,
	* The left terms in `result` get multiplied with the `prefix`
	* And the right terms in `result` get multiplied with the `suffix`
* Even if this is an initial observation, this puts you on the right track to come up with the given expressions for building `result`.
* Once you trace out fully for an example, you'll see that, naturally, `prefix` is multiplied all the way to the right end and `suffix` is multiplied all the way to the left end.

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        prefix, suffix = 1, 1
        result = [1] * n

        for i in range(n - 1):
            prefix *= nums[i]
            suffix *= nums[~i]
            result[i + 1] *= prefix
            result[~i - 1] *= suffix

        return result
```
