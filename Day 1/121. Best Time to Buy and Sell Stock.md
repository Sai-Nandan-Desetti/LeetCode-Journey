**Approach: One pass**
* You're considering buying on day `i`.
	* You need to make a decision based on a day `j` in the future
		* i.e. `j > i`
	* Side note: In real life, how can you know the future?
		* Take it as `prices` is a list of predictions.
* Compute the `profit` you earn by buying on day `i` and selling on day `j`.
	* Keep track of the max `profit` earned so far.
* Since you're looking to earn a *profit*, you must consider all days `j`
	* `while prices[j] > prices[i]`.
* Once you reach a day in the future where the price drops, consider buying on that day again. 
```py
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        profit = 0
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and prices[j] > prices[i]:
                profit = max(profit, prices[j] - prices[i])
                j += 1
            i = j

        return profit
```
