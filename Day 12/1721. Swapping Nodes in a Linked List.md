**Approach 1: Fast n Slow (Swap values)**

* **How do you find the `k`-th node from the end without traversing through the entire list and counting the number of nodes?**
	* Have two pointers: `slow` and `fast`.
	* Give `fast` a `k`-node headstart.
		* That is ensure that `slow` (which is standing on `head`) and `fast` are `k` nodes apart.
		* We have to traverse through `k` nodes beforehand. At least it's better than traversing through the entire list and counting.
			* But note that if `k == n`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list, we're compelled to traverse through the entire list nonetheless. The only thing we save in that case is the counting!
			* `fast` is now the `k`-th node from the beginning.
	* Then, if `slow` and `fast` move one step at a time, when `fast` reaches the last node, `slow` is the `k`-th node from the end.
* Swap the *values*.

#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def swapNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        fast = head
        for _ in range(k-1):
            fast = fast.next
        
        nodeK_beg = fast
        slow = head
        while fast.next is not None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next
        nodeK_end = slow

        nodeK_beg.val, nodeK_end.val = nodeK_end.val, nodeK_beg.val

        return head
```

**Approach 2: Swap nodes**
* It's not advised to swap *values*. What if, for example, there are multiple attributes in the node?
* To swap the nodes, we have to find the nodes *previous* to our desired nodes.
* Then, to be able to get the "previous node" of `head`, we need a `sentinel`.
* Here, `left` and `right` denote the `nodeK_beg` and `nodeK_end` above.
* `fast` and `slow` are used to find the nodes previous to these, respectively.
* Swap the *nodes*.
```
class Solution:
    def swapNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        sentinel = fast = ListNode(val=None, next=head)
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            fast = fast.next
        prevLeft, left = fast, fast.next

        slow, fast = sentinel, left
        while fast.next is not None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next
        prevRight, right = slow, slow.next

        prevLeft.next, prevRight.next = right, left
        left.next, right.next = right.next, left.next

        return sentinel.next
```
