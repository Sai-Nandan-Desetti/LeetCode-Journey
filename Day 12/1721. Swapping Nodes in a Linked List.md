**Approach 1: Swap the values**

* `left`: `k`-th node from the beginning.
* `right`: `k`-th node from the end.
```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def swapNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        sentinel = fast = ListNode(val=None, next=head)
        for _ in range(k):
            fast = fast.next
        left = fast

        slow = sentinel
        while fast is not None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next
        right = slow

        left.val, right.val = right.val, left.val

        return sentinel.next
```

**Approach 2: Swap nodes**

* It's not advised to swap *values*. What if, for example, there are multiple attributes in the node?
* To swap the nodes, we have to find the nodes *previous* to our desired nodes.
* Then, to be able to get the "previous node" of `head`, we need a `sentinel`.
* Here, `fast` and `slow` are used to find the nodes previous to the ones to be swapped, respectively.
* Swap the *nodes*.
```py
class Solution:
    def swapNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        sentinel = fast = ListNode(val=None, next=head)
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            fast = fast.next
        prevLeft, left = fast, fast.next

        slow, fast = sentinel, left
        while fast.next is not None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next
        prevRight, right = slow, slow.next

        prevLeft.next, prevRight.next = right, left
        left.next, right.next = right.next, left.next

        return sentinel.next
```

* **Why does `fast` start from the `sentinel`? Why not from `head`?**
    * We need a previous node if `head` itself needs to be deleted!

* **Why range only till `k-1`?**
    * It's given that the list is `1-indexed` and we need to get to the node previous to the `left` node.
